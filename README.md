# Time-Series-Deep-Learning

The ‘Household Power Consumption‘ dataset is a multivariate time series dataset that describes the electricity consumption for a single household over four years.

This data represents a multivariate time series of power-related variables that in turn could be used to model and even forecast future electricity consumption.

We will specifically look at:

Univariate and multivariate Encoder-Decoder LSTMs for multi-step time series forecasting.
CNN-LSTM Encoder-Decoder model for multi-step time series forecasting.
ConvLSTM Encoder-Decoder model for multi-step time series forecasting.

For learning Time Series Forecasting with Python, I recommend you an excellent book Introduction to Time Forecasting with Python (2017) by Jason Brownlee. Several examples and techniques in this notebook are presented and explained in more details in that book.
